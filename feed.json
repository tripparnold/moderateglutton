It needed to be thinned out by more pasta water than I expected - ended up a bit dry.</li>\n<li>✅ Flavored bread crumbs: crunchy, spicy, and saved the texture of this otherwise mushy dish.</li>\n<li>❌ Sous vide chicken - about the only way I'll cook a boneless, skinless (read: flavorless) chicken breast. Salted 8 hours ahead. Flavor was solid, but slightly dry. Maybe overbrined? Sous vide at 158 F for 1 hour &gt; rested 10 min &gt; seared in leftover shallot avocado oil.</li>\n<li>❌ Chickpea fusilli is meh. Despite the ❌, I actually liked it. But it pales in comparison to an al dente egg and semolina noodle.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Takeaway:</h5>\n<h5>A weirdly satisfying plate of health food dressed up like real pasta — the breadcrumbs did the heavy lifting.</h5>\n<p><strong>Rating: 6.3/10</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
