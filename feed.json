I have never cooked this and rarely eat these items.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What I experimented with:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Swamp sauce\" - Blanched kale, parsley, serrano, garlic, lemon juice and zest, EVOO, S&amp;P.</li>\n<li>Flavored bread crumbs - not sure why I haven't been doing this</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"undefined\" alt=\"\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></figure><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What I liked and disliked</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>✅ Swamp sauce was tasty and nutritious. It needed to be thinned out by more pasta water than I expected. ❌ I left it a bit dry. 6/10</li>\n<li>✅ Flavored bread crumbs. Simple and makes everything crunchy. This dish was all soft otherwise</li>\n<li>❌ Sous vide chicken - about the only way to cook a boneless skinless (flavorless) chicken breast. I salted about 8 hours before dropping in the bath. Flavor was great, but slightly dry still. Not sure if I brined too long or what. Sous vide at 158 F for 1 hour, rested 10 min, then seared.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://moderateglutton.com/media/posts/2/apr29_swampfussili.png\" alt=\"Swam sauce chickpea fusilli with sous vide chicken breast and toasted chili oil bread crumbs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" srcset=\"https://moderateglutton.com/media/posts/2/responsive/apr29_swampfussili-xs.png 640w ,https://moderateglutton.com/media/posts/2/responsive/apr29_swampfussili-sm.png 768w ,https://moderateglutton.com/media/posts/2/responsive/apr29_swampfussili-md.png 1024w ,https://moderateglutton.com/media/posts/2/responsive/apr29_swampfussili-lg.png 1366w ,https://moderateglutton.com/media/posts/2/responsive/apr29_swampfussili-xl.png 1600w ,https://moderateglutton.com/media/posts/2/responsive/apr29_swampfussili-2xl.png 1920w\"></figure>\n<p> </p>",
